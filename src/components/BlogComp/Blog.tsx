                When we imagine teaching process I see two important activity.
                First, where students take a particular lecture or class. Where a
                teacher explains a topic and important concepts. Second, part of the
                learning happens when a student goes out of the class. When he reads
                by himself and solves a question. While both parts are necessary but
                it is the second part that matters the most. Our product is for that
                second part.

                constitutes reading, doing questions, revising topic, mock test,

                it means learning by reading and practicing questions. I am breaking
                it for two parts. 1. First time learning and growing : Linear move
                2. Revision and Reassuring : In General, A student opens a Book or
                sheet by a coaching institute or a question bank book to start
                reading the concept and do practice from them. There are some good
                books. Similarly there are good question bank and coaching material.
                Every student starts from the beginning and travels as he or she
                flips the pages.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-6.5">
                One problem is the sequence of theory and question. They are mostly
                separate. Few theoretical part can only be understood unless prior
                theory has been understood completely and that comes only when you
                have practice it enough. This is critical in learning as the
                students mental state gets affected and it is such mental states
                compounded over the years that results in a better or worse student.
                These minor events creates a huge difference in overall performance
                of a student over the year. Now imagine someone is sitting right by
                the side of student at his private study hour. That someone knows
                the book, syllabus and its every details of it. And he give a page
                to the student for the immediate study. He watches the student
                carefully while the learning process goes on. And when it ends he
                hands over another sheet. Then the student learns this one. Again,
                at the end of the sesion that someone analyzes all the previous
                sessions and gives the student another sheet. And the process
                continues like thatâ€¦Crafting the learning process. When and what to
                read. When and what question to solve. We do this.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-6.5">
                Another problem arises when he gets stuck. Either he needs to wait
                for another day or see the solution. Some smart student goes back
                reads the question and tries it back. This process is very
                emotional. Many student see the solution and makes up his mind
                whether it is easy or hard. Whether he will be able to do the
                question next time or not. Learning is hard. And anyone who says he
                learns easy is basically a lie. It takes rigorous training in that
                particular subject for hours or month that makes a student or a
                person intuitive enough or smart enough to tackle the question
                easily or understand that concept. It is also that rigourous moment
                where the difference occurs. It is very emotional and affects a
                student psychologically for the subject and the study in general.

                Now imagine that someone, lets call him Mr. B and I will use this
                name through the document to describe our product as a human, who is
                already at the study table. When the student gets stuck. Mr. B hands
                over a small sheet. That sheet contains only a hint to go just one
                more step for the question. That sheet contains only that concept
                that needed to be applied to that particular question. That sheet
                contains only that concept that will help the student to understand
                the article he is reading. And once the student is done, he takes
                away the smaller sheet and walks him back to the question or article
                he was engaged with. Mr. B is different than a human teacher. He
                never gets frustrated. He never gets bored. He got all the time for
                that student only. The student feels slight tough, as learning is
                tough, but he never gets frustrated as a whole. He never goes
                anywhere else or looks for any alternative. He gets all the help he
                need by Mr. B. We do this.

                it means trying practice sheets exam and try to understand where
                they land. Primarily Assessment happens in two ways.

            <div>
                <p className="leading-6.5">
                a) when a teacher asks a question to the whole class and demands
                for the answer.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-6.5">
                b)Test series. Many students creates their own exam sessions and
                tries to assess them. The problem with these assessments are

            </div>

            <ol className="ol-list num-list list-outside">
                <li>They are in general.</li>
                <li>They are on a fixed time.</li>
                <li>It takes time to get the result.</li>
                <li>
                When a student does get the result, they see the performance as a
                function of questions asked and subjects entertained in the exam.
                </li>
                <li>They are also a fixed number of times.</li>
            </ol>

            <p className="leading-6.5">
                Now imagine if we can create an assessment after fixed number of
                concept. The assessment is unlimited and the students number of
                hours will determine when he gets one. What topic of assessment that
                needs to be done. Remember Mr. B was at the table. He knows where
                the problem was faced earlier and hence how a assessment should be
                created to test whether that concept is learned and understood or
                not! Mr. B has no other thing to do except thinking about that
                student. So he hands over the test result immediately. We create
                specific assessment for that student. Assessment happens whenever a
                student has studied enough that can clutter his thought and he needs
                an assessment. We do all that.

                it means keeping track of what happens in learning and assessing
                along with exams, schools and other factors which affects their life
                and are key aspects of their learning. There is a context of
                learning and students have some exam to crack. Students constantly
                need to check whether they are meeting the demands of the exam or
                not!
            </p>
            <p className="leading-6.5">
                This is mostly done by none. Only few students do make charts and
                plan for themselves. Most of them just follow school and college
                framework. This gets highly unmanaged. This is the reason why 60%
                student quit their preparation by the time they reach 12th standard
                for JEE or NEET. Another 20% also shift to boards six months before
                the exam. They start going on zig zag path and it is this mis
                management at this time which effects their outcome hugely. Now
                imagine if we keep tracking the exam requirement from the beginning.
                Keep proritizing the study show that minimum is always insured.
                Students , based on their number of hour and capacity, gets their
                own particular plan. Imagine while we teaching we expose them with
                the questions and study in a way that consecutively takes care of
                exam. Since now they do not need to worry for theminimum they can
                remain calm and feel more confident. No one knows what could be the
                highest height but we can, for sure, constrained the minimum
                threshold height. And when there is this level of management they
                will do wonders. We do wonders.
